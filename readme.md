# DeepLearning.AI Tensorflow Developer

Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)

## Applied Learning Project

In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, you'll get hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, you will be ready to: 

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow

- Improve your networkâ€™s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images

- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems

- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!
